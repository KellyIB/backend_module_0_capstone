## Checker Board

1. Create a file called checker_board.rb
2. Think about what you know about required output
  2. The Checker board pattern alternates starting with an "X" and starting with a space in an odd/even pattern
  2. think about how to define even and odd: a.even? (boolean), a % 2 == 0
  2. even = "X X X"; odd = " X X X"
3. Think about user input. (gets.chomp)
  3. Think about how to use numeric input.  
  3. Input is a string, gets.chomp to_i?
  3. use number to make an array for iteration?
4. Think about order of writing
  4. first things first. User input.
  4. convert input to integer
  4. create array using user supplied integer.
  4. iteration over array
  4. determine even/odd
  4. puts, not print
  4. write output associated with each number
5. write it and try it
    if it works, got to step 7
    if not
6. correct mistakes
  6. use error messages to find mistakes
  6. google error messages if needed
  6. try to understand why it didn't work
  6. research possible solutions
  6. go to whichever step in 4. the problem is, and start there.
7. celebrate
